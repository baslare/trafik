This repo is not meant to be pedagogical (for now). The code is sloppy but the gif below can still be reproduced using the istanbul_animate.R script (and the data/shapefiles supplied herein). In addition, the scraping script still works as of Feb 2022.

Steps:
 - Get the bus line codes from the IETT website
 - Get the necessary time and location data for the active bus lines
 - Clean and reshape the data
 - Animate
